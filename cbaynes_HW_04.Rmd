See _`r figure_nums(name = "Figure 1", display = "cite")`_

There are `r nrow(df.gradpain)` graduate students in the sample.

# What is the sample mean?
```{r create function, include=F}
# Function from Box 1
d.vec <- gradpain
n=5000
q1.F <- NULL
for (i in seq(from = 1, to = 94)){
  s <- sample(x = d.vec, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  m <- mean(s)
q1.F <- c(q1.F, m, n) 
return(list(length(q1.F), mean(q1.F)))
}
m1<-mean(q1.F)
```
The sample mean is approximately `r m`.

# What is the mean of these 100 means? 
```{r, include=F}
set.seed(7)
q2.F <- NULL
for (i in seq(from = 1, to = 100)){
  s <- sample(x = gradpain, size = length(gradpain), replace = TRUE)
  m <- mean(s)
q2.F <- c(q2.F, m)
}
m2<-mean(q2.F)
sd2<-sd(q2.F)
```
The mean and standard deviation of these 100 means are approximately `r m2` and `r sd2` respectively.
```{r, include=F}
library(Rmisc)
```
```{r, include=F}
set.seed(7)
n=length(gradpain)
num.samples <- 100
q3.F <- NULL
for (i in seq(from = 1, to = num.samples)){
  s <- sample(x = d.vec, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  m3 <- mean(s)
  sd3 <- sd(s)
  q3.F <- c(q3.F, s, n)
  ci_95 <- Rmisc::CI(x=q3.F, ci = 0.95)
  q3.Fii <- c(length(gradpain), num.samples, q3.F, sd, ci_95)
return(list(n, num.samples, q3.F, sd, ci_95))
}

upper_ci<-5.93
lower_ci<-4.83
```
# What does your function return for the mean of means?

The function returns `r m3` as the mean of means.

# What does your function return for the standard deviation of means?

The function returns `r sd3` as the standard deviation of means.

# What does your function return for the 95% confidence interval around the mean?

The function returns `r lower_ci` and `r upper_ci` as the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval around the mean.
